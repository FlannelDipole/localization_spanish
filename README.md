# Localizing Floor

Thanks for helping us to localize Floor! ðŸ¥³

## Voice, tone & brevity
The Floor voice is friendly, informal and informational.

In order to fit in an app originally designed with English language placeholders, favor the shortest version of the translation that can make idiomatic sense. Long strings will likely cause the UI to layout poorly.

## Language Files
The Floor app uses Xcode localization files to localize _every_ String in the app. 

`.xcloc` files are a folder structure of XML files which _can_ be edited manually but are much easier to edit on a Mac, by opening the File in Xcode.

You can edit the localized string for a particular language by opening the appropriate `.xcloc` file in Xcode, and then editing the third column with your suggested localization.

## Weird strings?
There are a number of "format" strings that express how numbers will be displayed e.g. `#%@`. Unless you know what you're trying to achieve, it's safe to ignore these and leave them untranslated.

These:

## Adding new languages?
Want a language that's not included?

Either... 
1. Create an issue and add the `new-langauge` label or...
2. Create a copy of one of the English language and change to the language code you'd like.
